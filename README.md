Data Extraction and Manipulation using Python: Extracting Specific Values from Text Files and Generating Excel Files
This is the project I have already developed in my workplace. It was requested by a user to extract specific columns from a text file and generate each header along with its corresponding values in rows and columns. The goal is to eliminate the manual conversion process, allowing the transition from text files to Excel to be automated.
